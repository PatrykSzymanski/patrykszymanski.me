              For the past 5 years, I have been gaining experience in both small companies and large corporations.
              Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to be a part of a product team, lead and build a UX team,
              and work as a freelancer.

              also covers B2B, SaaS, and e-learning industries.

              led a Design Team in <a href="https://www.datafeedwatch.com" target="_blank">DataFeedWatch</a>, a SaaS
              company focused on marketing solutions.</p>
            <p>
              With a master's degree in psychology, I have a solid background in cognitive science and human-computer interaction. I remain
