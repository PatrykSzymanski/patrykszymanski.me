          <p>Creating a website for LowSugar, a mobile app for diabetics.
            After leaving a Berlin innovation incubator, LowSugar's CEO wanted to start promoting the idea publicly. The
            website was supposed to serve as a landing page for social media and other digital marketing activities.

          <p>Together, we have defined two main goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>create a place to collect leads for the product</li>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <div class="gap-16">
          <p>I was the only UX professional working on the project, wearing designer, researcher, and workshop
            facilitator hats. The team was young and ambitious, yet not experienced with web design. My role was to get
            to the core message and design a website to meet strategic goals.</p>

        <p>
          During a workshop with a 3-people team (startup CEO, software developer, marketing specialist), we have
          defined the main objectives for the website and created a basic outline. Based on the outcomes, I created
          low-fidelity wireframes. After a round of feedback from team members, I created the hi-fi version. The website
          is not live yet, as LowSugar is currently on the lookout for investors.</p>

        <h2>The process</h2>
        <div class="gap-16">
          <h3>1. Co-design workshops</h3>
          <p>To create the framework for the website, I used a simplified <strong>Design Studio method</strong> (a
            workshop design method to use with teams).
            We worked together with a Miro board. Each team member had a moment to share their vision of the website and
            write down ideas for elements, visual design, UX, and website content.</p>
          <p>We went through all ideas and a feedback round. Working with all the collected ideas, we collectively
            rejected all the proposals that didn't fit the current budget and goals. Then, we prioritized ideas to be
            implemented first. We created the information architecture and established the website's scope.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="gap-16">
          <h3>2. Low-fidelity wireframes</h3>
          <p>Based on the results of the workshop, I created the first wireframes for the LowSugar website. I strived to
            make it simple in order to reduce implementation costs.</p>
          <p>The project was prepared based on Bootstrap 4 (a set of pre-defined GUI elements) to facilitate responsive
            web design implementation (pages that adjust to any device) for mobile devices and tablets.
            You can view the wireframes in the Results section.

        <div class="gap-16">
          <h3>3. High-fidelity mockups</h3>
          <p>My goal was to reach a solution simple and clear enough to minimize the need for subsequent tests. The main
            objective was to provide informational value for a potential customer who can easily see what the company
            does and why they do it, what is the story behind, and what the future plans are.</p>
